# RWRV Voxel file format
This is the GitHub repository for the RWVXL or RWRV Voxel file format, and RWVXLA, its animated variant.

This was made to test my creativity, programming skills, and give me something to work on, and I plan on massively expanding on this as time goes on. It's my first proper Rust project, though I might add Python support later, and by far the biggest thing I've done so far. I plan on adding graphical rendering, import and export from other formats, and possibly a visual editor in the future. Colour support is also on my mind but I can't promise anything

While this format is not powerful or anything, I do not need it to be. I'm not looking for a massively complex, massively comprehensive format with this, I'm not looking for users, I'm looking to have fun working on something. I also care about efficiency, which is why the file is about as efficient as an uncompressed voxel format can be, though I do understand it makes decoding more complex.

I'm also fully open to feedback, which is why I've got Issues, Discussions and Pull Requests all open. If you'd rather chat with me more directly you can friend request me on Discord at `rwrv`.
